# PAN-2-CrackMe
<b>What is this?</b>

A Crack Me designed to wreck your mind. It is intended for security researchers and beginner security researchers. This is the version 2, which is harder, if you're a beginner, <a href = "https://github.com/GeoSn0w/PAN-1-CrackMe"> start with PAN-1</a>.

<b>How to play?</b>

You must know how to reverse engineer binaries. This is a crack me designed for security researchers with at least some experience. Check PAN-1 if you are a beginner.
The idea is simple. The program accepts an username as a login, the username is hard-coded inside the program.
Patching branches is considered cheating. If you feel like doing that, it is ok, at least you know how to patch, but I would feel prouder if someone would tweet me the actual username.

The algorithm is simple but requires some thinking, and I can give you only 1 piece of advice: use HELP whent he program asks for a COMMAND to learn what commands to use.

Tweet me pics when you complete the challenge. ^_^

<b>Compatibility</b>

The binary is compiled as a MACH-O 64, so, yeah, macOS.

<b>Hall of fame</b>

<b>Nobody managed to crack it for the moment. Be the first!</b>

<b>Who made this?</b>

Me :)
